Account Administration
========================

Account and Group
-------------------
Each user of TGI RAILS must obtain an NCSA account and Duo software token. 
Each RAILS user will be a member of at least one allocated project which will map
to a group on the RAILS system. 

Management Tools
-----------------
You can manage your NCSA identity (change email, password, Duo device, etc) and project PIs
and allocation managers can add or remove accounts to their project with the
`NCSA Identity and NCSA group management tools <https://wiki.ncsa.illinois.edu/display/USSPPRT/NCSA+Allocation+and+Account+Management>`_.

**Configuring Your Account**
----------------------------

-  Bash is the default shell, submit a support request to change your
   default shell
-  Environment variables: SLURM batch
-  Using :ref:`module`

**Allocation Policies**
-----------------------

-  TGI awarded projects and allocations currently do not receive
   periodic messages regarding approaching project expiration.

-  Projects will no longer be able to run jobs after their project expires or their
   allocation is exhausted.

-  There is a 30-day grace-period for expired RAILS projects to allow
   for data management access only.
   
-  Following the grace period expired projects will be removed from the system and project data removed.
   
-  Any accounts no longer on an active project are removed from the system and their
   home directory data removed.

Allocation Supplements and Extensions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Requests for resource allocation supplements (compute, GPU, or
storage)and extensions can be made via the appropriate XRAS website.

-  TGI allocation PIs can find instructions for requesting supplements
   and extensions at the bottom `Delta Allocations
   page. <https://wiki.ncsa.illinois.edu/display/USSPPRT/Delta+Allocations#DeltaAllocations-Requestingan%22Extension%22or%22Supplement%22foranexistingDeltaallocation>`__ While that page documents the process for Delta projects, the process is the same for TGI RAILS projects.
